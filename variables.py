#A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)

#Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
x = 4 # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)

#If you try to combine a string and a number, Python will give you an error:
#x = 5
#y = "John"
#print(x + y)
